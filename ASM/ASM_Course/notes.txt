db    BYTES  ( 8 bits/1 byte )
dw    WORD   (16 bits/2 bytes)

dq    QWORD  (64 bits/8 bytes)


RSP (Stack Pointer Register) :
    - Used to point to the current top of the stack

RBP (Base Pointer Register) :
    - Used as a base pointer during function calls

RIP (Instruction Pointer Register) :
    - Special register used by the CPU to point to the next instruction to be executed.

rFlags (Flag Registers) :
    - rFlags is used for status and CPU control information. The rFlags register is updated
    by the CPU after each instruction and not directly accessible by programs. This register
    stores status information about the instruction that was just executed.

Cache memory :
    - Subset of the RAM located in the CPU chip. If a memory location is accessed, a copy
    of the value is placed in the cache. => Much faster to access a value.
